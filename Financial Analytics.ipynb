That is the question I would like to solve using the Data Analytics skills I have learned this semester. This answer will come from predicting 'Amount' values from different models.

    "It looks like my spending increased around the holidays in 2019. This makes perfect sense. Additionally, my purchases go down during Winter semester and plumets when I am laid off from work becasue of COVID-19. Surprisingly though, my purchases sky-rocket in June. This I can attribute to 1) receiving unemployment insurance (which was more than I was making at work), and 2) purchasing plane tickets for my travel to Virginia when my grandmother died. Post June, my expenses are still relatively high, as I am continuing to receive unemployment insurance, but the expenses steadily decrease as the year continued."

    "Another note on reformating the data for modeling. After making the dummy variables and proceeding with modeling and predicting, the predictions were terrible. I believe this is because the models never once predicted a value of 0 for any amount. At first quite puzzled by this, I realized this is becasue the original data never has an expense of 0; why would it, the data is only of my expenses. But, because we predict how much money I will spend in each category each day, there should be several days I spend nothing. Certainly, I should not be spending money in all 16 categories every single day - this is what was originally being predicted. So, to fix this, I have had to reconstruct the modeling data. This data will mirror the 'future data' we will get to soon. Each day will be repeated 16 times, once per category, and will have a 0 if I did not spend money on the category that day, and the actual values that I did spend. Then, building the other columns like 'Season' and others will be done just as it was before, only dummy variables will then be added to account for the factors as mentioned above.\n",

    "The Lasso Regression model produces only positive values. The prices seem to be uniform across all categories except for \"Fast Food or Snacks\".

    "\n",
    "The K Nearest Neighbors model produces various amounts. With the example of \"Hotels\", I only spent money in a hotel once last year. So, only seeing one charge for \"Hotels\" next year is a good sign to me. Also, the \"XBOX\" charges are uniform and low each month, which is basicaly what it should be since it is a subscription service. Additionally, this model seems to really understand the prices vary per 'Category', and the general shift in expenses seems to somewhat mirror actual trends suggested by my pivot table earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the Decision Tree model also produces some practical values, for the most part. Except for the \"Other\" 'Category', which only predicted negative values, each 'Category' is very different in the amount of money I am predicted to spend. Seeing all 0's in \"Airlines\", \"Debit\", and \"Hotels\" reflects the original pivot table very well, as well as the 16.08 charge for \"XBOX\" which is the actual subscription charge. This model predicts very low, if not 0, amounts for all of February. This also reflects the original data somewhat well. Despite the negative and one or two outliers, Decision Trees seems to have performed nicely."

    "So, how much money am I going to spend? Knowing myself, while I may not be the best at saving, I know I will not be spending anything close to what the Linear Regression model predicts. Some combination of K Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees appears to be the best prediction. Taking some values from one model and others from the other, I think the most practical predictions would come from both of these models working together. I am interested in how my actual expenses compare with these predictions."

    "After having fixed the modeling data, which got rid of the biggest bias of not predict 0 values, the only other bias I can think this model has is 'assuming' my income. Last year's expenses have been made based off my Cinemark and Unemployment Insurance income, depending on the month. Next year, however, I am planning on working for a company in my field of Statistics or Data Analytics, so the pay should be substantially higher, and therefore some expenses should be higher. However, if I imagine myself still working at Cinemark next year, then these values perform somewhat well.\n",

However, seeing how I have only had the Apple Card for a year (and that the UCCU debit card I have does not produce anywear near the sort of data Apple does), trying to predict per annum values with only one year of reference would provide severely limited (if any) variance.\n",

    "**Future Recommendations:**\n",
    "\n",
    "While this project was still chalk-full of informative details about my spending habits, performing such an analysis yearly may help me save more. In addition, to someone wishing to replicate a similar project or analysis, I would recommend first having more data available, but also suggest spending the majority of time focused on the EDA segment. Producing these graphs, as well as others I cut from the finalized notebook, was the most helpful for me to understand some of my spending habits. Of course, many large expenses are unplanned, like my trip to Virginia, but understanding smaller, more consistent spending can help one save for the bigger, one-time purchases."
